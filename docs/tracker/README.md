# Tracker introduction

The Lyticus tracker is a tiny javascript library that tracks various events (page view, click, etc...).

It is flexible and easily configurable: you control which events to track and when to track them.

It is designed to work with both server-side (Express, Koa, Spring, Laravel) and client-side (Vue, React, Angular) rendered applications.

The tracker for Lyticus is open-source.

Your suggestions and pull requests are welcome via [github](https://github.com/byteboomers/lyticus-tracker).
